## Show how to use the SVD to solve the least squares problem posed on page 11 in Lecture 6.

## Plot a few digit images from the MNIST data

The directory `mnist` has `mnist_read.R` file that reads the MNIST data.

Plot a few digits from the data set, possibly using the `image()` function, or something from the `ggplot2` package

NOTE: new version of `mnist_read.R` adds a flag to allow simultaneous access to the MNIST file. Previous version was assuming read-write access and that locks the file for everyone else while in use. The new version has read-only access.

This is a file example of the need for locks with shared resources, like we talked about in shared memory.
