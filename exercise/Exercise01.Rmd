```

## Exercise 1 - accounts

1. Create account on IT4I
   1. Connect with project
2. Create account on GitHub
   2. Create a private repository named ASwR
   2. Add go-ski as collaborator to give me access to that one repository

## Exercise 2 - answer with a sentence or two
1. What is your experience with parallel computing?
3. What is your experience with R?


## Exercise 3
* Put the script below (only code without the backtick lines) as a file in your ASwR GitHub repository, clone it to your IT4I account (`git clone http://...`), and run. 
```{bash}
#!/bin/bash
TXT='text.text'
MYTEXT1='echo $TXT'   # quote
MYTEXT2="echo $TXT"   # substitute
MYTEXT3=`echo $TXT`   # substitute and run
echo '$MYTEXT1' '$MYTEXT2' '$MYTEXT3'  
echo "$MYTEXT1"
echo "$MYTEXT2"
echo "$MYTEXT3"
echo `$MYTEXT1`
echo `$MYTEXT2`
echo `$MYTEXT3`
```

## Bonus:
* Explain why seemingly same echo line produces different output.
